Project Discription:
This project is a simple Flutter mobile application that displays a list of products. It consists of two main screens:

Product List Screen: Displays a list of products, each showing a title, description, and price. Clicking on a product navigates to the detail view.
Product Detail Screen: Shows detailed information about a selected product, including an image, title, description, and price.
The project is organized into different folders for screens, models, and widgets, ensuring clean code structure and scalability. It demonstrates the use of shallow and full widget trees for different UI elements.
